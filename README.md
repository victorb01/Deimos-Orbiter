# Deimos-Orbiter
Project coded as part of the Applied Orbital Mechanics course at University of Texas at Austin. Its goal is to simulate a spacecraft orbiting Mars’ smaller moon, Deimos.
A comparison of the simulated trajectories was made by varying which accelerations affecting the spacecraft were taken into account (the two-body term due to Deimos, Deimos’ non-spherical gravitation field, the three-body term due to Mars, and the three-body term due to the Sun).
